# Islandora Object Clone

Copies an Islandora object and persists the copy much in the same manner that https://www.drupal.org/project/node_clone does for Drupal nodes.

## Introduction

Performs a shallow clone of the source object, that is, it only copies the object properties and datastreams. It does not generate new objects corresponding to any children the source object have.
